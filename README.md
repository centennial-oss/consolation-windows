A 100% free, no-frills, incredibly performant video capture viewer for Windows with no analytics or snooping.

Consolation is coming soon to the Microsoft Store. We do not provide releases on GitHub due to the cost-prohibitive nature of code signing certs. If you do not use the Microsoft Store, clone the project and build with Visual Studio.

## About

Consolation is a free app that enables your Windows computer to be used as a display for devices like gaming consoles, Raspberry Pis, and even a Mac mini or other PC, via a standard USB Video Class (UVC) video capture card.

The app is intentionally simple: watch the live video on your computer. No recording or saving, no streaming to the internet. Just plug and play, privately with no ads or tracking. Consolation will never make an outbound network request or listen for inbound network connections.

## Screenshots

Coming Soon.

## Privacy

Consolation does not collect, send, or share your data. Audio and video stay local and transient while you are watching a connected capture device. The app is open source, contains no trackers or analytics, makes no network calls, and does not record, stream, save, or analyze audio or video. Consolation has no idea what content is coming through your capture card's feed, and nothing leaves your device, ever.
